- Quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA) for portfolio optimization
- Risk-return analysis and Sharpe ratio calculation
- Fallback to realistic demo data when live data is unavailable

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd quantum_optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_live.py
```

See [quantum_optimization/README.md](quantum_optimization/README.md) for detailed documentation.
